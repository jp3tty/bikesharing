# Bike Sharing Proposal for Des Moines

## Overview
For this project, NYC "Citi Bike" data is used as a business case to demonstrate that a bike sharing business can be viable in large urban environments.

Data visualizations are used in a Tableau Data Story ([Tableau Data Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeremy3008/viz/NYCBikeshareChallenge_16411709534240/NYCStory)) to show Citi Bike's rider breakdown, view their bike usage, and compare their "Customer" and "Subscriber" users.


## Results
Inspection of the NYC data reveals that over 2 million rides occured in August of 2019, a majority of which were subscribers to the Citi Bike service.

## Summary
Based on the data, Citi Bike's bike share is a viable business in NYC because the "Subscribers" make up a bulk of the sevices ridership. The same could be said for a Citi Bike bike share in Des Moines.

In order to make a stronger case for dispatching a bike share service in Des Moines, a comparison on each cities demographics is required.
